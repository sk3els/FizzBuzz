FizzBuzz code exercise

Notes:
  - I elected to do the exercise in Python.  I later saw that it was a req to upload the .js and .json file.  Hoping this still works.
  - First time using Docker.  I admit that following the ENV instructions, I may have not followed the instructions correctly and it may have made my client code messier.. ?  I'm also unsure about requirements.txt since our virtual environment/dependencies are contained within the Docker container.
  - I'm admittedly a Git newbie.  I did read the instructions on including the .gitignore, but I'm unsure on what files I'm supposed to tell it to ignore.
 
 Thanks for the challenge.  If I failed, I at least learned a few things along the way.  Have a good day!
