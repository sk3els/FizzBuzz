FizzBuzz code exercise

Notes:
  - I elected to do the exercise in Python.  I later saw that it was a req to upload the .js and .json file.  Hoping this still works.
  - First time using Docker.  I admit that following the ENV instructions, I may have not followed the instructions correctly and it may have made my client code messier.. ?  I'm also unsure about requirements.txt since our virtual environment/dependencies are contained within the Docker container.
